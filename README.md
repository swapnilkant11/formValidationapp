# Form Validation Application

A form validation app using javascript, bootstrap and css.

## Assumptions

There are few small assumptions made my me which designing the webpage:-

1. The reset button is used to clear the form field.
2. The phone number should be of 10 digits and not in the form starting with +91.
3. The next record on the webpage will be submitted and shown after refreshing the webpage filling all the fields and clicking the submit button, while the present record can be displayed by clicking on the submit button after all the fields are filled appropriately.
4. The password should be of at least 6 characters.
5. The postal code should of of 6 digits.
6. The last name is not necessary to be filled due to the userâ€™s comfort or if the user do not have any lastname, an error should not be displayed.
